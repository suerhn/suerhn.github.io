Thinker, tinkerer, team player. 

BA in Political Science, MSc in Data Science and Engineering. Previously at IBM, Vault Dragon, and Golden Equator, working on data analytics and market research. 

My background uniquely positions me as a critical thinker and collaborator who bridges business and tech. I'm passionate about learning from others, deciphering interesting problems, and delivering real-world value through tech.
