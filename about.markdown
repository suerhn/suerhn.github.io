Thinker, tinkerer, team player. 

BA in Political Science, MSc in Data Science and Engineering. Previously at IBM, Vault Dragon, and Golden Equator, working on data analytics and market research. 

I love working with people who are passionate about what they do. I believe there's always something new to learn. Solving interesting problems while creating value through technology energises me!
